# wordleHelper

WinForms based Tool to cheat when playing [wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle).

It uses the [word-list](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt) from [dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) - it reads the word-list from the included file - if you were to exchange that (keep the same name) it can use your own.
